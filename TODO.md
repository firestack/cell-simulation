TODO: 

- Implement a simple scripting interface.

- Better scoring system.
- Better genome system.

- Add species.
    - Allow breeding between cells of the same species.
    - Implemented anti-inbreeding and racism.
    - Cell division.

- Allow species to die off and populate.
- Allow similar cells to clump together.
- Add a trait system.
- Add death by over eating/drinking.
- Allow the cells to poop? XD

- Fix the weird lag/test if it is the stream/obs causing the random frame glitch.
- Fix the camera zoom speed at high zoom levels.

- Leave a dead carcase when a cell dies and allow other cells to eat or drink from it.

- Some sort of better food if water and food are mixed together (ie more nutirents)
- Different types of food / mixing (ie some are better than others)

- Neonz27 method of breeding!
- Chemical-'markers'-things.

- Give the cells a small field of view.
    - Change the inputs to visual data rather than exact data.

- Give the cells a texture overlay.
- Some sort of natural disaster.

- Give the cells some sort of trap (or something that steals from other cells)

- Setup the git for the nex library and for the cell simulation project.

- Auto config based on the window width.

- You should make a website where people can bet on which cell will survive the longest.

- Allow people to selectivly breed cells in their own private tank.
- Once they get a cell they like, they can upload it to the server so it is battled against other players, then each is scored based on how well their cell did in a number of battles.
- Slowly make each sucessive battle enviroment harder and harder.

- A battle anounncer. (must have for the multiplayer battles)
